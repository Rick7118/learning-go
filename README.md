# Learning Go

This repository is my journey learning the Go programming language.  

I started by following the official [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/), but honestly, I found it a bit boring to go through linearly. So, I decided to switch things up and learn Go **through building projects**.  

Currently, the code in this repository covers the basics of Go up to **if-else statements** and **for loops** (since Go doesnâ€™t have traditional `while` loops) as per the Tour of Go.  

## Whatâ€™s in this repo

- Basic Go syntax
- Variables and types
- Constants
- Functions
- Control flow: `if`, `else`, `else if`
- Loops: `for` (the only loop type in Go)
- Simple examples demonstrating these concepts

## My Approach

Instead of just reading and completing exercises from the tour, I will be:

- Trying out small projects to reinforce concepts
- Experimenting with Go features in practical scenarios
- Gradually covering more advanced topics through hands-on coding

## Next Steps

- Arrays, slices, and maps
- Structs and interfaces
- Building mini projects along the way
